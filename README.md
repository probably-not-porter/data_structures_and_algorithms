Repository to practice with various languages by way of recreating and translating algorithms and data structures.

My implementations are original code, though some are created with reference to other implementations, or textbook/internet research.

## *index.html*
This file was created to suppliment testing and demonstration of JS sorting functions. It is a simple static webpage which allows the user to interact with any of the implemented algorithms and data structures.

## Current Languages
My goal is to implement these things in all the languages I can, in order to practice with different languages, and build up a bank of algorithms to be used in other projects of any language.
