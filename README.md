# Data Structures and Algorithms
Repository to practice and catalogue all my work on various datastructures, as well as search and sort algorithms.

My implementations are original code, though some are created with reference to other implementations, or textbook/internet research.

## *index.html*
This file was created to suppliment testing and demonstration of JS sorting functions. It is a simple static webpage which allows the user to interact with any of the implemented algorithms and data structures.

## Current Languages
My goal is to implement these things in all the languages I can, in order to practice with different languages, and build up a bank of algorithms to be used in other projects of any language.
