Repository to practice with various languages by way of recreating and translating algorithms and data structures.

My implementations are original code, though some are created with reference to other implementations, or textbook/internet research.

## Running Examples
All my implementations are built with examples along side them, which are used for testing and demonstration. Here are terminal examples for running these examples. It is assumed that these commands are run from the root directory of this project after it is cloned to your local machine.

### **Python**
Make sure you have Python 3+ installed on your machine.
```
python3 sort_algorithms/python/<ALGORITHM>.py
```
### **Javascript**
The Javascript example are unusual, as they are more interactive. Using the provided `index.html`, the user can create and sort arrays using the javascript implementations.
### **Golang**
Make sure you have Go installed on your machine.
```
go run sort_algorithms/golang/<ALGORITHM>.go
```
### **PHP**
Make sure you have PHP installed on your machine.
```
php sort_algorithms/php/<ALGORITHM>.php
```

## *index.html*
This file was created to suppliment testing and demonstration of JS sorting functions. It is a simple static webpage which allows the user to interact with any of the implemented algorithms and data structures.

## Current Languages
My goal is to implement these things in all the languages I can, in order to practice with different languages, and build up a bank of algorithms to be used in other projects of any language.
